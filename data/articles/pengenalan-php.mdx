# PHP Installation

## What Do I Need?

To start using PHP, you can:

- Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
- Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL

---

## Use a Web Host With PHP Support

If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

Just create some `.php` files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.

You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.

Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.

---

## Set Up PHP on Your Own PC

However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

- install a web server
- install PHP
- install a database, such as MySQL

The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php

# PHP Syntax

A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.
A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`:

```php
<?php
// Malah Ngoding PHP Article
?>
```

The default file extension for PHP files is`.php`
A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function `echo` to output the text "Malah Ngoding" on a web page:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Malah Ngoding";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

---

## PHP Case Sensitivity

In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
In the example below, all three echo statements below are equal and legal:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

---

**Note**: However; all variable names are case-sensitive!

Look at the example below; only the first statement will display the value of the $color variable! This is because $color, $COLOR, and $coLOR are treated as three different variables:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "<br>";
echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>
```
